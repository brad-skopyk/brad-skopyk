# Climate and New World Virgin Soil Epidemics: A Spatio-Temporal Approach to Understanding the Intersection of Mass Mortality, Spanish Imperialism, and the Little Ice Age in Early-Colonial Mexico

## Climate & Depopulation

Little debate remains about the extent and depth of American depopulation in the wake of European expansion from the 15th to 18th centuries. The population of even the largest, most militarized, and politically agile societies in the Americas, including those groups that allied with the invaders and thereby negotiated a far less coercive form of subjugation than neighboring polities, experienced a population collapse of at least 75% by the end of the first century of European control. This is equally true for the region of central Mexico, the focus of this essay and one of the most densely settled regions of the New World, if not the world. When a general census was carried out in 1643 by the Spanish colonial administration, probably only about 5-10% of the preconquest population remained [Gerhard: 22-28].

Until recently, historians have tended to associate mass mortality almost exclusively with the new diseases that arrived from the Old World and then spread to immunologically defenseless native populations. Before Alfred Crosby popularized the so-called 'virgin soil epidemic' paradigm in 1976, the theory had been gaining traction in public health bureaucracies of colonial states, such as  Canada and the U.S.A. Beginning in the 1940s it was used to explain disease outbreaks in tropical island and Arctic communities that were experiencing a sudden wave of new imperialism. 

In the last twenty years, however, scholars have pushed back against the VSE theory, challenging a narrative that had stripped imperialism of any real culpability in the decimation of American populations. Rather than downplaying immunological factors (i.e. the lack of acquired immunity amongst the native population), research highlights the many ways in which imperialism could shape mortality and fertility outcomes, a methodological approach that I call political-epidemiology. War and coercion, for instance, increased mortality rates during the onset and coping phases of the epidemics when families were torn apart through military recruitment, death, or acts of terror and pillaging. These approaches have focused mainly on the decades between epidemics, especially on the impoverished conditions of everyday colonial life. Hunger, infertility, hard labor, forced migration, and general cultural and social upheaval reduced birth rates and increased mortality rates, thereby complicating the apolitical lens of the VSE paradigm (see Alchon, Matallana Peláez, and Livi Bacci).

Despite the theoretical acuity of this new research, the interrogation of the material conditions of daily life under European rule has rarely moved beyond qualitative regional assessments. Research has not clarified the degree, locations, and time periods in which standard of living contributed to the suppression (or acceleration) of population regeneration, at least not for the time period before the late colonial era. Historian Amilcar Challú, for instance, has examined the variance of human height with access to food, focusing mainly on climatic and political factors in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In this work, Challú documented significant biological  stress in the last fifty years of the Spanish empire in Mexico [see his chapter "The Great Decline" in Living Standards in Latin American History]. Other historians have calculated real wages, either for Mexico as a whole or for major urban centers like Mexico City, to compare the standard of living in Mexico with that of other nations. This scholarship shows that the Mexican economy was roaring along throughout most of the colonial era. Per capita GDP reached a climax around 1710 and remained strong throughout the colonial era [Abad & van Zanden 2016], while buying power rose dramatically from 1580 until 1670, falling only after 1770 as conflict, demographic growth, and economic reforms took hold [Abad, Davies & van Zanden 2011]. Throughout much of the eighteenth century, real wages were actually higher in Mexico City than in Madrid [Abad & van Zanden 2016: 1999]. The rise of real wages in Mexico had an inverse relationship with population trends. Real wages rose when population fell, a pattern accentuated in times of demographic collapse. When Mexico experienced sustained growth in real wages and per capita GDP for more than a century after the early-colonial pandemics, it followed a well-trodden path to recovery, not so different from the demography of London, England, after the Black Death.
